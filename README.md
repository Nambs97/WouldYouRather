# Would You Rather Project

Would You Rather is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not authorized.

In this app, users will be able to :

1. answer questions,
2. see which questions they haven’t answered,
3. see how other people have voted,
4. post questions,
5. and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

This repo is a code-along with the second project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
